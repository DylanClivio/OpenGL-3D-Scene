# OpenGL-3D-Scene
How do I approach designing software?:
This project helped me practice breaking down my project into modular pieces and implementing them efficiently, one at a time, into my final project. I focused on things like lighting, texture, shapes, and camera movement as individual projects and then tied them all together in a finished project. This benefits me with future work by helping me conceptualize the project and understand how all the pieces come together.
//
How do I approach developing programs?:
Developing programs has to be approached methodically, by first examining and understanding project requirements and how they fit together. Taking an incremental approach to development allows for each category of the project requirements to get full attention. This aids in the comprehension of the project. My approach to developing evolved while building this project because this project introduced me to something completely new that required me to implement previous knowledge of C++ and apply it to a new environment.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?:
Learning about computational graphics and visualizations gave me the opportunity to see a new implementation of C++ and provided me with a better perception of full-stack project development. This project makes me more well-rounded as a programmer.
